## What Are Quantum Computers?

**Classical computers** (phones, laptops) work with bits that are either 0 or 1, solving problems step-by-step.

**Quantum computers** use qubits, which can be 0, 1, or both at the same time (a quantum phenomenon called *superposition*). This allows them to explore many possible solutions simultaneously.

**Quantum computers excel at:**

- Simulating molecules and materials (e.g., cleaner fertilizers, better batteries)
- Testing chemical reactions virtually (faster drug discovery)
- Solving complex problems that would take classical computers years or centuries

## Quantum Programming Basics

**Quantum programming** means writing instructions for a quantum computer instead of a classical one.

- In classical programming, you tell the computer what to do with 0s and 1s.
- In quantum programming, you instruct the computer how to work with qubits, which can be 0 and 1 at the same time.

**Key differences:**
- You set up a problem; the quantum computer explores many answers at once
- You measure the system to get the final result

   - Good for: Beginners, learning quantum circuits

2. **Cirq (Google)** – *Python library*
   - Python for defining quantum circuits, especially for Google’s hardware
   - Free: Open source
   - Paid: Hardware access may cost
   - Good for: Low-level circuit design control

3. **Q# (Microsoft Q-Sharp)** – *Standalone language*
   - Quantum-only language (not Python) by Microsoft
   - Free: Part of Quantum Development Kit
   - Paid: Azure Quantum hardware access may cost
   - Good for: Learning quantum algorithms with full tooling

4. **PyQuil & Quil (Rigetti)** – *Python + low-level backend*
   - Python interface (PyQuil) for the Quil instruction language (Rigetti systems)
   - Free: Libraries and simulators
   - Paid: Real Rigetti hardware access may cost
   - Good for: Hybrid quantum/classical programs

5. **Other Useful Tools**

## Recommended IDEs & Tools

- **VS Code** — Free, popular for quantum coding (Qiskit, Q# extensions)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** — Free, interactive browser notebooks (great for Python frameworks)
- **Visual Studio** — Free Community Edition supports Q#; paid versions offer more features
- **Quantum Development Kit (QDK)** — Free Microsoft toolset with Q# debugging

Most quantum languages are Python-based or run in free environments like VS Code/Jupyter. Paid options are mainly for access to real quantum hardware.

**What are quantum computers**

**Classical computers** (phones, laptops) work with bits that are either 0 or 1. They solve problems step-by-step.
**Quantum computers** use qubits, which can be 0, 1, or both at the same time (a quantum trick called superposition). This lets them explore many possible solutions at once.

Because of that, quantum computers are especially good at:

 - Simulating molecules and materials → helps design cleaner fertilizers and better batteries

 - Testing chemical reactions virtually → speeds up drug discovery
Solving very complex problems that would take normal computers years or centuries

**Quantum programming** means writing instructions for a quantum computer instead of a normal one.

**In normal programming,** you tell the computer what to do with 0s and 1s.

**In quantum programming,** you tell the computer how to work with qubits, which can be 0 and 1 at the same time.

Because of this:

 - You don’t program steps as much as set up a problem The quantum
 - computer tries many answers at once 
 - You then measure it to get the final result

### Top 5 Quantum Programming Languages & Frameworks

1.  **Qiskit (IBM)** – _Python-based_
    
    -   **What**: Most popular framework to write quantum programs. Uses Python code.
        
    -   **Free**: Yes — open source, free tools + free IBM quantum hardware access (cloud).
        
    -   **Paid**: Optional premium compute credits on IBM systems.
        
    -   **Good for**: Beginners & learning quantum circuits.
        
2.  **Cirq (Google)** – _Python library_
    
    -   **What**: Python for defining quantum circuits, especially for Google’s hardware.
        
    -   **Free**: Yes — open source.
        
    -   **Paid**: None for the code, hardware access may cost.
        
    -   **Good for**: More control over low-level circuit design.
        
3.  **Q# (Microsoft Q-Sharp)** – _Standalone language_
    
    -   **What**: Quantum-only language (not Python) built by Microsoft.
        
    -   **Free**: Yes — part of free Quantum Development Kit.
        
    -   **Paid**: Azure Quantum hardware access can have costs.
        
    -   **Good for**: Learning quantum algorithms with full tooling.
        
4.  **PyQuil & Quil (Rigetti)** – _Python + low-level backend_
    
    -   **What**: Python interface (_PyQuil_) for the Quil instruction language used on Rigetti quantum systems.
        
    -   **Free**: Yes — libraries and simulators.
        
    -   **Paid**: Running on real Rigetti hardware may cost.
        
    -   **Good for**: Exploring hybrid quantum/classical programs.
        
5.  **Other Useful Ones**
    
    -   **PennyLane** – Python for **quantum machine learning** (free).
        
    -   **OpenQASM** – The low-level assembly language that many quantum tools generate.
        
    -   **Guppy** – New Python-based language to simplify quantum coding (free).
        

**IDEs (Coding Environments)**

-   **VS Code** — Free and popular for quantum coding (extensions for Qiskit, Q#).
    
-   **Jupyter Notebooks** — Free interactive browser notebooks (great for Python frameworks).
    
-   **Visual Studio** — Free Community Edition + supports Q#; paid versions have more features.
    
-   **Quantum Development Kit (QDK)** — Free Microsoft toolset with debugging for Q#.
    

Most quantum **languages are coded in Python or inside free environments like VS Code/Jupyter**, so you don’t _need_ to pay to start learning. Paid comes into play mainly for access to **real quantum hardware** rather than the language itself.
